# Download Strava Data
Uses the [strava v3 API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/).  
Relies on two excellent helper libraries:  
[stravalib](https://github.com/hozn/stravalib) to ease the use of the Strava API in python  
[stravaweblib](https://github.com/pR0Ps/stravaweblib) to perform web scraping to workaround (deliberately) missing features in the API
